xf86-video-openchrome-0.3.0

This  is the first official openchrome driver release.
(http://www.openchrome.org)

SUPPORTED CHIPSETS :
--------------------
- CLE266 (VT3122)
- KM400/P4M800 (VT3205)
- K8M800 (VT3204)
- PM800/PM880/CN400 (VT3259)
- VM800/CN700/P4M800Pro (VT3314)
- CX700 (VT3324)
- P4M890 (VT3327)
- K8M890 (VT3336)
- P4M900/VN896 (VT3364)


SUPPORTED FEATURES :
--------------------
- Free modesetting for Unichrome and Unichrome Pro chipset.
- VBE modesetting for everything not natively supported. 
- TV out support.
- EXA acceleration.
- Hardware MPEG2 acceleration.


IMPORTANT NOTE :
----------------
- The driver name is now 'openchrome', that's what you need to use in your xorg
  conf now. The XvMC libraries have also been renamed to libchromeXvMC.so and
  libchromeXvMCPro.so


KNOWN BUGS/LIMITATIONS :
------------------------
* Laptop panel
- Laptop's panels for anything but CLE266 and KM400/P4M800 are only supported 
  thru VBE calls.
- Xv is not working on laptop's panel for VM800/CN700/P4M800PRO. It is however
  working on VGA.
- Virtual terminal is broken on some laptop's panel. Use a vesa framebuffer to 
  workaround that (append vga=791 to your kernel command line for example).

* XvMC
- The hardware MPEG4 acceleration that is present on some chipsets is not
  implemented.
- No XvMC support for CX700 (new unsupported engine)
- No XvMC support for K8M890, P4M890 and P4M900/VN896 (need to get dri working 
  for them first) 

* TV output
- TV modes are hardcoded and must be choosen inside a list depending on the TV
  encoder.
- Outputs are dependant on each other and will use the lesser common
  denominator. If you're using both VGA/LCD output and TV output, the VGA/LCD 
  output will be limited by the TV encoder (720x576@50Hz for example). 
  In other words, there is no dual screen support.
 
* Misc.
- Add-on and integrated TMDS encoders are not supported, except true VBE.


Please note that 3D acceleration is provided by Mesa (http://mesa3d.org) and is
not directly related to openchrome.
